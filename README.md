## Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a web server on AWS using **Amazon EC2** instances. The web server can serve static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or act as a backend for dynamic applications (e.g., Flask, Django, Node.js). It leverages AWS services like **S3** for storage, **RDS** for databases (optional), and **CloudFront** for content delivery (optional).

## Features

- **Scalable**: Deployed on AWS EC2 for scalability.
- **Secure**: Configured with security groups and IAM roles.
- **Customizable**: Supports static websites, APIs, or full-stack applications.
- **Automated Deployment**: Includes scripts for automating setup and deployment.
- **Cost-Effective**: Optimized for AWS Free Tier usage.
